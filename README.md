# Stock Prediction with LSTM

This repository contains a Stock Prediction model implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model is designed to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices based on past performance. The model utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like stock price forecasting.

## Features

- LSTM neural network architecture for time series prediction
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Training script for model training
- Evaluation script for model performance assessment
- Prediction script for generating future stock price predictions
- Jupyter Notebook for demonstration and analysis

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Prepare your historical stock price data in CSV format.
   - Ensure the data includes relevant features such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and optionally volume.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use the provided data preprocessing script to clean and preprocess your dataset.
   - Normalize the data if necessary to ensure consistent scaling across features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the LSTM model using the provided training script.
   - Tune hyperparameters as needed for optimal performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using the evaluation script.
   - Assess metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Utilize the prediction script to generate future stock price predictions.
   - Adjust the prediction horizon and other parameters as required.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for optional visualization and analysis)
